How am I supposed to improve my life when I constantly want to die,"
Even during my depression I’ll get these small mini bursts of optimism and motivation thinking, “maybe I can make it?! Maybe I can improve my life and be happy!” And I’ll go to the gym for one day, or run, or try to learn something new, but that’s short lasted. The second I complete the task all I can think is. “What’s the point? I’m probably going to die anyway, so why spend time improving myself?” 

I honestly have no will to even live life, all my energy is spent just existing by distracting myself and spending money on stupid shit just to forget about life.

I feel stuck in purgatory. Not courageous enough to kill myself, not motivated enough to make myself happy. I’m stuck. Existing.",Yes,Yes,yes,Yes,UND,No,Yes
Should I click yes to give the psychiatrist permission to share my information with one of my parents? What are they gonna share?,"So I finally opened to my parents that I've been struggling with depression, but didn't tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. They've been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. There's a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really don't want them knowing about the real reason why I'm depressed. I feel like I'm obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?",No,No,No,No,No,No,No
What would you do in my position?,"I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school. I like to think I’m more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why I’m so unsure about something, I’m just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. 

Background:
In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didn’t tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made (who were the girls) was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I don’t even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents weren’t all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. “There are people having it worse than you” (which I agree. But I don’t think that’s the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person). “You’re crying over a girl”(I’m relating to that one year I was victimized). It didn’t help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. He’s younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. That’s was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. 


Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that I’ve faced really made me think that there’s no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what I’m saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. I’m thinking it’s because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what I’m trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had low-temper. Which is not true. It’s really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. I’m not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. 


Also a side note: 
I’m a person who is fearful. I tend to not believe what happened and become regretful of many things. It’s a major flaw that I try to get rid of. It’s really hard to explain. I tend to be so caught up in the past that I can’t accept what’s in front of me. I can’t interpret what’s happening in that moment. 

What would you do if you were me? I don’t want my parents involved because they won’t understand me at all. I don’t want to tell my brother because he’s so illogical and I think he hates me for whatever reason. I have no friends to talk to that would understand me. And I have no confidence to stand up myself at this point. What would you do?",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes
SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much?,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and ""old""-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just ""too"" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

Your experience with SSRI's,"Have you ever gone off of SSRI?

Did you go off cold turkey or taper off?

What was the experience like?

Do you regret it or applaud it?

Did going off of your SSRI change your life for the better or the worst?

Did you feel your symptoms were actually manageable with therapy and coping skills after going off SSRI?

I'm 30 years old. I've been struggling with PTSD, OCD, Anxiety and Depression symptoms my entire life and I've just now accepted that I need to get help. I didn't have my first therapy visit until yesterday. I'm totally okay with therapy, but I'm scared to try medication. I have an appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist on 2/6/2019. The side effects and dependency on medication scare the living shit out of me. I don't want to lose myself.

Two Faced People - Need Advice,"So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said ""speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you"" and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I can't get any girls and stuff. It didn't bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, I'm not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I should've done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didn't say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I don't know why she would have said that.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No

I rely on him for helping me work through my anxieties, which often revolve around complex sociological and existential questions.

"I hate myself so much, I don't deserve to live","I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I don't have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about people's flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I don't really have any unique characteristics /personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this *mood* at the moment, that's how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my *hate*  *jealousy* and whatever sin from the Bible I embody.

Teenager with no hope.,"I'm a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. It's gotten so bad, I don't even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \[X\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or at-least, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life.",No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No
I'm really depressed and I want to get help but I don't know what to do,"I have always known I was a little depressed, but once the pandemic hit all of the things I did to keep myself “normal” disappeared and I spiraled out of control. I got dismissed from my school a few months ago because I failed all of my classes for both 2020 semesters and most days don’t get out of bed. I have done absolutely nothing productive since getting dismissed because every time I try I get really emotional about the dismissal. I am really scared to go to the dentist because I know I haven’t been taking care of my teeth. It is a minor miracle if I shower more than once a week. I feel like life is just passing me by, every day I wake up and then blink and I’ve spent the past 12 hours in bed and I didn’t accomplish anything.   


All of my friends are extremely accomplished people with jobs or internships lined up and I have literally nothing because I can’t get myself to DO anything. I’m too ashamed to reach out to them about it, I also just feel like they wouldn’t understand or have any helpful advice. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I cannot help it. I don’t want to get into the details but I am also trying to process some traumatic things that happened to me in the past few years and some days I have are just dark. I am not suicidal but I do have some intrusive thoughts about suicide occasionally which are starting to become more frequent.

  
I am turning 25 soon and I want to get help before I get kicked off of my parent’s insurance. But I don’t know anything about what to do. Do I get a therapist? Psychiatrist? Or something else? How do I find one and how do I pick the right one? I had a bad experience with a therapist when I was younger which has put me off of this until now :/ Are there other steps I should be taking? I don’t even know what to do, I just know I can’t live like this anymore. Asking my parents for help directly about this is also not an option for me, at least not yet, which is also why I'm posting here. Thanks for reading.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes

Placing too much on outside help?,"Hello,

I (20m) am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior (I caused my own problems) and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. (Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again) 

I have been spiraling (more or less) over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. 

The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. 

I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 5/9 (May 9th - USA), but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is “tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it”. 

This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who can’t afford help and have gotten along just fine. It’s your life, and at the end of the day it’s on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying it’s pointless. 

Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniques/routines/activities did you use / partake in?  What helped change your perspectives? 

Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No

Feeling so down and beating myself up for mistakes,"I don’t feel like talking about whatever is going on in my post since it might be too long. So to simplify it: I made a mistake asking someone from a laptop repair shop to back up files onto a hard drive. I didn’t think too much about what I did so of course I wasn’t surprised when my parents were mad at me. I tried to fix the situation by calling and texting to let them know of the situation. Then my mom just starts calling me out and calling me names cause I kept making mistakes. I get that I don’t think through things sometimes and it gets to me, but my mom really tried to drag me through the dirt cause she thinks so highly of her golden child compared to me. It got to me and I fought back verbally. I was so mad at her at that moment and couldn’t believe the things that she said.

I’m now sure that whatever my mom said is going to and will affect me. I just barely have the motivation to do anything at the moment.

How do I make a female partner who's depressed feel better?,"(**repost because i forgot to use my alt)**

Hey guys. So I'm hanging out with my girlfriend on Friday, who is depressed and may have some sort of bpd issues (as pointed out by multiple redditors). They have been irritable and angry for a long time, and there's a lot on her mind, so I'm giving them the week without talking to her to recollect her. I was hoping to get everyone's advice on how I should talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make clear that they does not think she's depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, (sometimes) excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried about her and if she won't accept and get help herself, I'm trying to see how I can make things better. The stuff I have planned out on Friday are:

1. I surprise her by letting her choose what I get her for valentine's day
2. We cuddle and watch a movie or something
3. She goes out with some friends who are moving away
4. when she's back, we hang out again and maybe watch our favorite tv show.
5. play some kind of video game or just talk

Are any of you able to tell me what else I can do to make my partner feel happier? Like whether it's daily or what I can just do on Friday. I want her to come out of her rut and be happy like she was once before. I'm really trying to make it fun but not suffocate her. We've been fighting a lot lately and it got pretty bad so I'm willing to do whatever.

Thanks
