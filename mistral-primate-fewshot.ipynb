Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life.

Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that I'm trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself there's no honor in it anymore, it's just another job. I don't exercise by myself anymore. I feel like I'm not progressing anywhere in life being in service. I'm just a body and if I wasn't here doing what I'm doing, there'd just be somebody else doing the exact same. I'm replaceable. That's the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and that's the only thing I've been looking forward to since I've been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. There's nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it.

      "Question:  My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn't believe it works. Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.  In recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:     •She doesn't socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything ‘new' (due to the cost).    •She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself ‘too old' to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as ‘they wouldn't notice me if i was there anyway'. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn't miss a day ever!     •She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn't like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have ‘done their job' and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won't even consider making an appointment to get a script.     •She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.     •Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to ‘just talk' and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels ‘better' or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.      •Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that ‘people' think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma's care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.     •She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.     •Frequently making statements such as  ‘just wanting to die', ‘I should just die', ‘someone should just shoot me', ‘i'll just die'. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day. There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.  For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.     •Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.     •Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma's health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn't dealing with Grandma's care anymore she is still stressed about it.     •She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting ‘cold-shouldered' and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).  I have tried to help her by:     •Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will ‘get fat again').     •To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it ‘doesn't work', also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been ‘fighting' with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).     •Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a ‘why bother' mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she ‘doesn't feel like it').    •Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.     •Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).     •Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed ‘supervision').     •Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.  Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn't complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to.   What more can we be doing?  TLDR: My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal. I've run out of ways to help, what can I do?  location: Victoria, Australia \n"
