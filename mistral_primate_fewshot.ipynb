She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn\\u2019t believe it works.\\nPreviously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.\\n\\nIn recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:    \\n\\u2022She doesn\\u2019t socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything \\u2018new\\u2019 (due to the cost).   \\n\\u2022She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself \\u2018too old\\u2019 to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as \\u2018they wouldn\\u2019t notice me if i was there anyway\\u2019. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn\\u2019t miss a day ever!    \\n\\u2022She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn\\u2019t like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have \\u2018done their job\\u2019 and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won\\u2019t even consider making an appointment to get a script.    \\n\\u2022She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.    \\n\\u2022Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to \\u2018just talk\\u2019 and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels \\u2018better\\u2019 or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.     \\n\\u2022Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that \\u2018people\\u2019 think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma\\u2019s care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.    \\n\\u2022She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.    \\n\\u2022Frequently making statements such as  \\u2018just wanting to die\\u2019, \\u2018I should just die\\u2019, \\u2018someone should just shoot me\\u2019, \\u2018i\\u2019ll just die\\u2019. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day.\\nThere have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.\\n\\nFor further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.    \\n\\u2022Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.    \\n\\u2022Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma\\u2019s health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn\\u2019t dealing with Grandma\\u2019s care anymore she is still stressed about it.    \\n\\u2022She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting \\u2018cold-shouldered\\u2019 and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).\\n\\nI have tried to help her by:    \\n\\u2022Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will \\u2018get fat again\\u2019).    \\n\\u2022To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it \\u2018doesn\\u2019t work\\u2019, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been \\u2018fighting\\u2019 with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).    \\n\\u2022Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a \\u2018why bother\\u2019 mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she \\u2018doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019).   \\n\\u2022Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.    \\n\\u2022Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).    \\n\\u2022Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed \\u2018supervision\\u2019).    \\n\\u2022Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.\\n\\nLast night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn\\u2019t complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. \\n\\nWhat more can we be doing?\\n\\nTLDR: My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal.
