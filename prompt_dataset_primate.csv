How am I supposed to improve my life when I constantly want to die,"
Even during my depression I’ll get these small mini bursts of optimism and motivation thinking, “maybe I can make it?! Maybe I can improve my life and be happy!” And I’ll go to the gym for one day, or run, or try to learn something new, but that’s short lasted. The second I complete the task all I can think is. “What’s the point? I’m probably going to die anyway, so why spend time improving myself?” 

I honestly have no will to even live life, all my energy is spent just existing by distracting myself and spending money on stupid shit just to forget about life.

I feel stuck in purgatory. Not courageous enough to kill myself, not motivated enough to make myself happy. I’m stuck. Existing."
Should I click yes to give the psychiatrist permission to share my information with one of my parents? What are they gonna share?,"So I finally opened to my parents that I've been struggling with depression, but didn't tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. They've been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. There's a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really don't want them knowing about the real reason why I'm depressed. I feel like I'm obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?"
What would you do in my position?,"I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school. I like to think I’m more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why I’m so unsure about something, I’m just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. 

Background:
In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didn’t tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made (who were the girls) was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I don’t even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents weren’t all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. “There are people having it worse than you” (which I agree. But I don’t think that’s the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person). “You’re crying over a girl”(I’m relating to that one year I was victimized). It didn’t help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. He’s younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. That’s was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. 


Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that I’ve faced really made me think that there’s no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what I’m saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. I’m thinking it’s because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what I’m trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had low-temper. Which is not true. It’s really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. I’m not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. 


Also a side note: 
I’m a person who is fearful. I tend to not believe what happened and become regretful of many things. It’s a major flaw that I try to get rid of. It’s really hard to explain. I tend to be so caught up in the past that I can’t accept what’s in front of me. I can’t interpret what’s happening in that moment. 

What would you do if you were me? I don’t want my parents involved because they won’t understand me at all. I don’t want to tell my brother because he’s so illogical and I think he hates me for whatever reason. I have no friends to talk to that would understand me. And I have no confidence to stand up myself at this point. What would you do?"
SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much?,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and ""old""-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just ""too"" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

Your experience with SSRI's,"Have you ever gone off of SSRI?

Did you go off cold turkey or taper off?

What was the experience like?

Do you regret it or applaud it?

Did going off of your SSRI change your life for the better or the worst?

Did you feel your symptoms were actually manageable with therapy and coping skills after going off SSRI?

I'm 30 years old. I've been struggling with PTSD, OCD, Anxiety and Depression symptoms my entire life and I've just now accepted that I need to get help. I didn't have my first therapy visit until yesterday. I'm totally okay with therapy, but I'm scared to try medication. I have an appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist on 2/6/2019. The side effects and dependency on medication scare the living shit out of me. I don't want to lose myself.

Please help and be completely honest."
Two Faced People - Need Advice,"So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said ""speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you"" and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I can't get any girls and stuff. It didn't bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, I'm not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I should've done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didn't say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I don't know why she would have said that."
How can I force myself to do important things when I’m feeling like shit?,"I (f,23) was extremely depressed for a very long time. I took meds, worked on myself, got better, but now I’m going downhill again. It fucking sucks because i have a lot of opportunities in front of me and I’m not working on anything because I’m simply feeling like shit. and idk how i can force myself to do those things even though ik that if i don’t do them ill be ruining my future. 
I just need some tips or anything that u thought helped u get shit done in hopes that it will get me to do the things that i have to do. 
Thank you and apologies for the language I’m just extremely frustrated."
I feel like i'm loosing my best friend and I don't know what to do,"My friend has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. He changed how I view the world and idk what i'd do without him. I rely on him for helping me work through my anxieties, which often revolve around complex sociological and existential questions. Recently he started college, and he hasn't really seemed to have time for me. Questions and anxieties pile up in his pms and he only occasionally responds. I can't lose him."
"I hate myself so much, I don't deserve to live","I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I don't have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about people's flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I don't really have any unique characteristics /personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this *mood* at the moment, that's how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my *hate*  *jealousy* and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why can't I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore."
My reward system is fked,"I really want to start living. I can't focus, concentrate or work on anything. I eat shit, sleep like shit and indulge in all horrible things. I want to start working on myself and finding that magic in life cause its gone and it has been for the past 19 years. How do I work towards enjoying things like exercise, working, learning and focusing? I have no control over my life and I did enjoy these things at one point. Its causing me so much pain and sadness."
My dad just threatened me for crying and going to my room and i would really need some kind words," My brother has a past with drugs, he always mistreat everyone and my father says we should stay calm 'cause we could make him go violent.

Today my dad told me that everything i do is because i want to bother them (liking piercings and wanting to initiate in hellenism). And now that i went crying in rage and sadness to my room without breaking anything (as my brother does) my dad came to tell me that if i keep this up he's gonna get violent.

Everyone ignored me in r/FreeCompliments so i'm posting this here wishing someone give two flying fucks about me"
Teenager with no hope.," I'm a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. It's gotten so bad, I don't even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \[X\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or at-least, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life. "
I'm really depressed and I want to get help but I don't know what to do,"I have always known I was a little depressed, but once the pandemic hit all of the things I did to keep myself “normal” disappeared and I spiraled out of control. I got dismissed from my school a few months ago because I failed all of my classes for both 2020 semesters and most days don’t get out of bed. I have done absolutely nothing productive since getting dismissed because every time I try I get really emotional about the dismissal. I am really scared to go to the dentist because I know I haven’t been taking care of my teeth. It is a minor miracle if I shower more than once a week. I feel like life is just passing me by, every day I wake up and then blink and I’ve spent the past 12 hours in bed and I didn’t accomplish anything.   


All of my friends are extremely accomplished people with jobs or internships lined up and I have literally nothing because I can’t get myself to DO anything. I’m too ashamed to reach out to them about it, I also just feel like they wouldn’t understand or have any helpful advice. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I cannot help it. I don’t want to get into the details but I am also trying to process some traumatic things that happened to me in the past few years and some days I have are just dark. I am not suicidal but I do have some intrusive thoughts about suicide occasionally which are starting to become more frequent.

  
I am turning 25 soon and I want to get help before I get kicked off of my parent’s insurance. But I don’t know anything about what to do. Do I get a therapist? Psychiatrist? Or something else? How do I find one and how do I pick the right one? I had a bad experience with a therapist when I was younger which has put me off of this until now :/ Are there other steps I should be taking? I don’t even know what to do, I just know I can’t live like this anymore. Asking my parents for help directly about this is also not an option for me, at least not yet, which is also why I'm posting here. Thanks for reading."
"What helped you see some hope for your future, and how can I help my friend see even just a glimmer of hope?","A dear friend of mine was diagnosed with dysthymia and I’ve been doing my best to support and talk when he wants to. 

One of the biggest things right now is that he sees no hope for life to be normal again, and no hope for being able to get a normal job after he graduates because of Covid requirements at jobs. How can I encourage him?

(Please don’t suggest anything about talking about “a new normal” because we’ve been down that road a few times and it never ends well. He is very hesitant about change.)"
Placing too much on outside help?,"Hello,

I (20m) am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior (I caused my own problems) and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. (Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again) 

I have been spiraling (more or less) over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. 

The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. 

I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 5/9 (May 9th - USA), but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is “tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it”. 

This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who can’t afford help and have gotten along just fine. It’s your life, and at the end of the day it’s on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying it’s pointless. 

Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniques/routines/activities did you use / partake in?  What helped change your perspectives? 

Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far"
My grandma just passed away how do I deal with the loss,So back story I was basically raised by my grandma I was always at her house I was always with her I was always close she was in the hospital/nursing home for 3 months Sunday night/Monday morning she was rushed over to the er cause her BP was low af then that night me and my mom and my grandmas sister went to go vist her but I didnt think it was that bad so I took my grandma puppy home cause he had to go to the bathroom and she knew then she was gonna pass so that night she was transferred to a different hospital and they was talking to her then she just feel asleep and never woke up we decided to take her off life support cause that's what she wanted how do I deal with this I never got to say goodbye while she was alive I got to see her while she was unconscious and I told her I love her but I just feel like I failed her
It's so painful,My best friend stopped talking to me 2 days back. It's been so lonely. I am having lucid dreams of him coming back. I am talking to an imaginary version of him in my head. Coz no one else understood me but him. Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me.We have a duplex. I am supposed to stay in the upper flat. They do give me food water and everything. But it's so painful. I am dying inside. My whole body is aching and I am feeling sick. I can't sleep well. I wish everything would just stop.
I need help,"My english is bad sorry
Ok so I have bad migraines every 2 days and I googled it and it says that depression, neck pain and migraines are connected. I go to therapy but I dont take antidepressants. My suicidal thoughts are awful lately and when this stupid corona thing goes away should I talk to my therapist and talk to her about it? How should I tell her that I need antidepressants? I really need them because I read that they can help with depression and migraines at the same time."
Feeling so down and beating myself up for mistakes,"I don’t feel like talking about whatever is going on in my post since it might be too long. So to simplify it: I made a mistake asking someone from a laptop repair shop to back up files onto a hard drive. I didn’t think too much about what I did so of course I wasn’t surprised when my parents were mad at me. I tried to fix the situation by calling and texting to let them know of the situation. Then my mom just starts calling me out and calling me names cause I kept making mistakes. I get that I don’t think through things sometimes and it gets to me, but my mom really tried to drag me through the dirt cause she thinks so highly of her golden child compared to me. It got to me and I fought back verbally. I was so mad at her at that moment and couldn’t believe the things that she said.

I’m now sure that whatever my mom said is going to and will affect me. I just barely have the motivation to do anything at the moment.

As you can tell, I’m probably not doing so well and would be down to talk or chat with someone."
How do I make a female partner who's depressed feel better?,"(**repost because i forgot to use my alt)**

Hey guys. So I'm hanging out with my girlfriend on Friday, who is depressed and may have some sort of bpd issues (as pointed out by multiple redditors). They have been irritable and angry for a long time, and there's a lot on her mind, so I'm giving them the week without talking to her to recollect her. I was hoping to get everyone's advice on how I should talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make clear that they does not think she's depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, (sometimes) excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried about her and if she won't accept and get help herself, I'm trying to see how I can make things better. The stuff I have planned out on Friday are:

1. I surprise her by letting her choose what I get her for valentine's day
2. We cuddle and watch a movie or something
3. She goes out with some friends who are moving away
4. when she's back, we hang out again and maybe watch our favorite tv show.
5. play some kind of video game or just talk

Are any of you able to tell me what else I can do to make my partner feel happier? Like whether it's daily or what I can just do on Friday. I want her to come out of her rut and be happy like she was once before. I'm really trying to make it fun but not suffocate her. We've been fighting a lot lately and it got pretty bad so I'm willing to do whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

I feel myself slipping again,"I’ve been at February vacation away from school  this year and I can’t help but feel I’ve been wasting it. I’ve done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times I’ve left my house are for sports practice which I **dread** and just despise. 

I think it’s been a long time coming but in the past few hours I’ve felt myself slipping in again to the pot of despair where I’m more irritated, testy, emotional and numb, and moody, and overall a pit in my stomach forms that I have to live through. They’ve happened more and more and for longer durations since I began  taking meds and therapy. 

Any advice at all on how to buffer this dread and flare of depression would be greatly appreciated, I can already feel myself sliding into it and just about all advice is appreciated."
Should I be drunk all the time?,"When I'm sober I feel depressed, anxious, and sad at all times. Maybe sometimes I feel a little happiness or excitement on top of it all, but it last minutes, if not seconds.

I'm currently intoxicated and remembered briefly what I normally feel, thus my question. 

When I'm drunk or especially drunk AND high (weed) I feel so much better. I'm happy in the moment because I simply can't remember what I'm not happy about. Are there any negatives to being drunk and/or high at all times, other than while I'm working? Any reason to be sober?

I ask only because I can easily manage to be drunk and/or high on a very regular basis and I feel better than I have in months."
Self-Improvement help,"After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.

The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.

I also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.

I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.

Probably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:

\- Manage &amp; control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous

\- Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time

\- Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert ""adopted"" him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.

\- Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.

\- Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.

I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?

My most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well."
Idk how to get out of this funk I’m in,"So I’ve been out of school for the past month now because of the plague and honestly idk how to recover from... whatever I’m going through.

Like I understand that self isolation is important, and I get that it’s required and I want to do whatever I can to help, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s making me go insane. I keep telling myself I shouldn’t be angry or let it get to me because I’m living with my mom who’s in a nice house and I have books, computer, a switch, and all the Netflix and Disney+ I could want, but I cannot find motivation to do anything.

I really don’t do well with online schooling in general, and on top of that I’m an art major taking 16 credits of classes that all have finals of performances so online school just got a whole hell of a lot more inconvenient. And I’m doing my best but I didn’t “go” to class today or Monday because I just couldn’t get out of bed. 

I feel like if I could find something to work on I’d feel better but I just feel like nothing is coming to mind. I joked with a friend about starting a YouTube channel because at the very least it’ll give me a project to focus on and improve my video editing skills (double major film production and theatrical design so it also feels relevant to my future) but I don’t have any ideas or content which is probably a large problem in that plan.

Idk, does anyone have advice for how to actually find motivation to do stuff? I’m struggling to do anything that isn’t work (I work at my university but because I moved off campus I now have ~1.5 hour commute each way) and I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life away doing nothing when I could be doing something."
Am I ungrateful for not being happy?,"The thing is compared to many people in the world I am pretty fortunate and privileged. Yet I am unhappy. I can’t help but feel like maybe I’m being stupid. I shouldn’t be unhappy when I have so many advantages in my life that billions in the world don’t have. I can’t help but feel like I am ungrateful. Yet I do not authentically feel happy. Am I being ungrateful/stupid?

Looking for success stories from adults who have been depressed most of their lives,"Hey. So, I’m 26 years old and really struggling at this moment. I’ve struggled since I was probably 4 or 5 at the latest, maybe even earlier than that, due to extreme isolation/neglect. I first tried to kill myself when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I’ve lived a very lonely life riddled with abuse, poverty, extreme trauma, and negligence. There’s not many bright spots.

I have PTSD, depression/anxiety, likely ADHD and who knows what else. I recently stopped medicating with marijuana, which I used for over 10 years. It’s brought up a lot of these shitty past feelings and reminded me why I needed to escape.

I’ve been in therapy with several handfuls of different therapists, tried several medications, and I do all of the usual shit like yoga, daily exercise, good sleep/diet etc. but I’m still completely miserable no matter how much I try to put a positive spin on things.

I’ve given myself until I’m 30 years old to feel some sense of normalcy or contentment, or else I am going to end my life, because I can’t continue on like this. I feel like that should be more than enough time to see if I have a shot at a decent life or not.

Has anyone else been this deep in the hole, and managed to get themselves out for more than just short periods at a time? I know life is full of ups and downs, but I’m tired of suffering 360/365 days out of the year (this might even be being generous). I’m really hoping someone out there has a similar background and has made a better life for themselves. I’d love to hear about it, in face I kind of need it right now.

In case it helps you help me to know this, I feel that I still suffer a lot from loneliness (I can’t own pets due to rent restrictions and I have trouble making friends despite constant efforts), and I have a lot of anxiety/pessimism around the state of the world, mostly environmental/economical. I think these are the big things holding me back, but there’s probably more.

Cheers, looking forward to hearing some hopefully positive stories."
What is wrong with me? How can I go from content to suicidal in a couple of hours?,"I don’t want to do anything. When I’m forced to leave the house or get the courage to do so, I don’t feel as trapped anymore. When I’m around people who don’t know about how I’m doing, I seem to pull myself together and act normal. I can smile, laugh and make jokes and it feels good. But as soon as I come home, I just don’t want to exist at all anymore. I feel so alone even though I know that there are people I could reach out to. It’s scary and it feels like I’m just making this all up because misery just feels so familiar to me. I’m not diagnosed with any type of mood disorder. 
I used to be so independent, now it feels like I can’t breathe when I’m alone"
How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide.,"My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn’t believe it works.
Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.

In recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:    
•She doesn’t socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything ‘new’ (due to the cost).   
•She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself ‘too old’ to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as ‘they wouldn’t notice me if i was there anyway’. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn’t miss a day ever!    
•She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn’t like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have ‘done their job’ and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won’t even consider making an appointment to get a script.    
•She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.    
•Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to ‘just talk’ and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels ‘better’ or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.     
•Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that ‘people’ think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma’s care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.    
•She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.    
•Frequently making statements such as  ‘just wanting to die’, ‘I should just die’, ‘someone should just shoot me’, ‘i’ll just die’. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day.
There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.

For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.    
•Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.    
•Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma’s health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn’t dealing with Grandma’s care anymore she is still stressed about it.    
•She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting ‘cold-shouldered’ and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).

I have tried to help her by:    
•Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will ‘get fat again’).    
•To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it ‘doesn’t work’, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been ‘fighting’ with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).    
•Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a ‘why bother’ mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she ‘doesn’t feel like it’).   
•Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.    
•Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).    
•Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed ‘supervision’).    
•Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.

Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn’t complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. 

What more can we be doing?

TLDR: My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal. I’ve run out of ways to help, what can I do?

location: Victoria, Australia"
No matter what I think I feel like I can't stop myself from suicide,"I've spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time I'm thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just don't see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters.

I just feel like unless I kill myself I'll just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point I'm not even sad anymore, I'm just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, I'd rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I don't know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then there's nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together. So I'm just left lonely and at that I'd rather have been dead."
I can’t describe what i felt anymore,It will be 2months already since she broke up with me. I already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause it’s really impossible. She’s already happy with her someone new. For me I already accept it and it’s good to know that she’s happy already. But its still hurt a lot to the point that there’s no more tears to cry. My chest is feeling numb to the pain that I’m feeling. My emotions is like a roller coaster right now I’m feeling hurt later. I feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. I don’t know at what point of life is me right now
I'm 18F and I don't know if I'm depressed,"I'm 18f and I just feel so sad all the time. I don't know if it's depression and I just feel so lost. I don't have any other way to explain it. I'm too scared to tell anyone but I've taken some tests online and they say I have moderate depression but idk if I'm choosing the answers correctly ( like correctly meaning the way they apply to me). I just feel like not getting up ever again, and thinking that I wanna be alive but I don't want to do anything. I just need clarification. You guys can ask me questions in order to help me, that would actually be much appreciated.

I just need the help guys, I need to know why I feel this way. So please please help me."
What can I do to stop being a weirdo?,"A lot of people have called me a weirdo and I know why. 
I laugh really loudly (it's super obnoxious and I think I do it because I'm an attention seeker and it make it seem like what my friend and I are talking about a lot funnier that it actually is because I want people to think I'm funny). I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)
I fidget a lot and I can't keep my hands to myself 
I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure 
I'm not feminine in any way. I don't care of my appearance and I smell (but I just don't feel like taking care of myself, I know it's a crappy excuse). I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I don't know why I can't bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. 
As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this. 
I don't know if it's because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe I'm acting like that because I believe it too. 
I don't think I'm insane but, maybe I'm wrong?
It's driving people away and it's driving me insane. 
I'm not aware of my surroundings and it really pisses people off, including myself. 
I really need some advice and I want to know why I'm acting like this and what I need to do to be a better person."
"Fell back into binge eating, not taking care of myself, oversleeping.. Spiraling.","Hi guys,

Like the title states.. I fell back into my depression spiral 2 weeks ago after getting fired at work. It started with just the binge eating part, but then i started neglecting my hygiene again, not showering, not leaving my house, ignoring everyone.. Started oversleeping and eating like crap/not exercising made me feel awful physically and very worn out. 

I gained 5 or so pounds, i skipped working out for 2 weeks and my sleep schedule is messed up (either sleeping 2 hrs or up to 14, no inbetween). My anxiety due to low confidence is back full force. 

I know i shouldn’t be hard on myself, but i feel awful. 

Any tips on how to get back on track?"
Overthinking is killing me,"I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some "" friends "" in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. That's when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I can't even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didn't overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help."
Taking antidepressants or not?,"I'm told i have social anxiety and depression. I talked to my doctor and he says i could start taking antidepressants, like prozac etc. I used to be neutral towards medication, but now i just want to function like a normal human being and still I'm not sure if it'll work or it'll be worth it. 

I did a bit research how prozac affects people, negative/positive. And now I just feel so confused. is it worth the risk, some people say 'wish i never took it' and some are just grateful. My family is already against those kind of medications but i turned 18 lately so it'll be my decision.

I will have to study for university exam this year and i can't even imagine myself studying. i just don't feel like doing anything. i feel like i don't even care anything enough. and doctor says it'd help with all this exam stress too, that i could study better etc. says it has so little side effect and it's not addictive. says I'd have to use them nearly 1/2 or 1 year to it affect me positively. 

i just don't know what to do right now and feel confused"
am I suicidal even if I know I won't kill myself?,"Sorry I don't usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, I am not going to kill myself. I care too much about other peoples feelings. And my cats. But all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. I've been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time I have seriously considered self harm-I guess as a way to escape the internal pain? I haven't taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. I'm irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldn't acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindset-I have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. I've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... My question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though I know I won't end my life, I would just like to. Anyone else experience this?"
My brains are fried...,"Sometimes I can't help but laugh bitterly at the fact that I used to be the smartest in my class and now I struggle to focus and remember for even half an hour. I read things over and over and it hardly sticks.I feel like an idiot really. Even things that interest me are hard. 

Part of me wants to just give up, cause the thing I am studying isn't even that useful, it's more to help myself. Is there any way I can improve my brain?"
Should I tell my therapist I'm suicidal,"The tile says it all. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time. I haven't attempted in years but I still feel this impulse/want to end my own life. Everything I just too hard, depression is kicking my ass, all of that stuff and more. Recently, I have gotten closer to killing myself than I have in past. On the way back from my lunch break I almost smashed into another car, on purpose, I sped up to make it so I'd finish me. I thought about how much money my parents would have to spend to fix the car and stopped before I hit the car. I have a therapist I meet with once a week over the phone but I:m afriad if I tell him he'll silv the big men with big nets on me. My mental illness already hurst my family, and I don't want it to anymore. Should I tell my therapist I'm having these thoughts?"
"""Paying for happiness"" - anyone else?","Some quick background: I have struggled with anxiety and depression for much of my adult life (I am 43). For many years it was low-level and manageable, with occasional flare-ups, but an extremely traumatic event three years ago triggered a period of major depression in my life that I am still dealing with. I am very high-functioning - most of the people in my life probably wouldn't even know of my struggles if I wasn't very candid about them - but it can get really, really bad sometimes. 

I have gone to therapy for over 15 years now and for the past few years have regularly seen multiple therapists. I was on various SSRIs/SNRIs over the years but they never did much of anything for me and I have been off all meds for about 14 months now. I did GeneSight pharmacogenomic testing recently and it turns out that I have significantly reduced folic acid conversion (which is apparently a common characteristic of people with major depression) and so I started taking folinic acid supplements a little over a month ago to try to help with this. No noticeable improvement yet.

I have also been doing psychedelic-assisted therapy for about a year now, which includes weekly talk therapy with a strong focus on processing childhood traumas, reintegration, IFS (internal family structures) therapy, and the like. As part of this therapy, I have done 5 ""journeys"" so far. This has been the therapeutic regimen that I have felt the most growth and progress from, but I am still plagued with lots of issues. 

I really feel like I'm throwing everything but the kitchen sink at my depression (plus stuff like meditation, exercise, sometimes yoga, etc. etc.) but nothing every really ""takes.""

I have noticed a pattern recently where when I am able to experience true happiness (which is fairly uncommon for me - not just feeling pretty okay but genuinely feeling joy, having actual fun, etc.), I will inevitably experience a comedown within 1-3 days. And the better I feel, the harder the comedown is. It is like getting high on a euphoria-producing drug and then having the inevitable crash. It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back; the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own body/mind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day.

I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really don't think that's it. Certainly yo-yoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals - a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesn't just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the ""punishment"" that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down - it's just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesn't feel like any kind of manic episode I've heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. 

Does anyone else experience this? Any suggestions?!"
What can I do…,"My (21F) bf (20M) is going through severe depression, and I don’t know how much more I can help. Him being in a low place drains me a lot, but I’m constantly scared of him doing something to harm himself. In these past few days he has constantly been expressing how tired he is of living, how he doesn’t think he can do it (live) anymore, and how he wish he was never born. I can feel that he’s always trying to push me away so that he won’t hurt me anymore, but then he says that I’m the only person and thing that he cares about. 
We’re gonna seek professional help asap, but both me and him are scared that he won’t be able to tough it until then. 
Seeing him like this crushes me and makes me sad, and I want to help him."
